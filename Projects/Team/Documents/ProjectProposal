"Want to order food for an office anniversary/birthday party/Group Meetings/Traditional Food for festivals or other occassions?"

Currently there is no reliable way to order catering online. We want to build a next generation and easy to use web app.
 Users can easily order food from their favorite restaurants on the web app.
as well as get traditional food from other persons not just to book only through restaurants.

Booking : Skim through dozens of restaurants near your locality and order asap!

Output:

1) An app that contains restaurants,People who prepare trad food reviews and ratings. Users can place orders (>Rs 10,000).
2) A console for the restaurant to view the catering order

This is an opportunity to learn making responsive sites.
 Also, learn deeply about how technology intersects with logistics.
